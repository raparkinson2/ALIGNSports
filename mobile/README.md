# Team Manager

A mobile app for recreational sports teams to manage schedules, rosters, check-ins, payments, and team communication. Supports multiple sports including Hockey, Baseball, Basketball, Lacrosse, Soccer, and Softball.

## Known Crash Fixes

**Login crash on fresh install**: `teamSettings` can be `null` before Zustand persist hydration completes. All accesses to `teamSettings.*` in `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and `(tabs)/index.tsx` must use optional chaining (`teamSettings?.field`).

**Game detail black screen**: `game.jerseyColor` can be `null` from Supabase (stored as empty string `''`). All jersey color lookups must use a safe fallback (`safeJerseyColor = game.jerseyColor ?? '#1a1a1a'`). An error boundary (`GameScreenErrorBoundary`) wraps the game detail screen to prevent black screens and log errors.

## Sync Architecture

All real-time sync is handled by **Supabase Realtime** via a single WebSocket channel per team (`team-sync-v2:${teamId}`). The local Zustand store is a pure in-memory cache. On login, `loadTeamFromSupabase` fetches all data fresh.

**Foreground reconnect**: When the app returns from background (`AppState` change), the realtime channel is forcibly restarted and data is reloaded to catch any changes missed while backgrounded. This is critical for TestFlight where iOS may drop WebSocket connections.

**Multi-team sync**: `loadTeamFromSupabase` now also updates the `teams[]` array entry for the loaded team with full player/game/event data. This is required for `hasMultipleTeams` detection in the More tab to work correctly after app restart or team switch.

**Multi-team startup recovery**: On app startup, `_layout.tsx` checks Supabase for all teams the logged-in user belongs to. If any are missing from the local `teams[]` array (e.g. due to the previous parallel-load race condition), they are loaded sequentially. This fixes the issue where only 1 of 4 teams appeared in the team selector.

**Multi-team switching**: Team switching works WITHOUT calling `setIsLoggedIn(false)`. The correct flow is: set `pendingTeamIds` via `setPendingTeamSelection()`, then `router.replace('/select-team')`. The `_layout.tsx` auth guard will keep the user on `select-team` while `pendingTeamIds` is set, and only redirects logged-in users away from `inAuthGroup` screens (not `select-team`). After creating a second team, the user is shown the team selector automatically.

**Photo deduplication**: The uploader registers the photo ID in `syncedIdsRef` before inserting to Supabase, preventing the realtime INSERT event from adding a duplicate.

**Registration flow (email users)**: When a pending Supabase invitation is found for an email address, the app routes the user to Step 2 (create password) based ONLY on whether they have an active Supabase Auth session (`isAlreadyLoggedInWithEmail`). The local store's player password field is NOT used for email users because `loadTeamFromSupabase` pulls player passwords from Supabase into the local store, and these can be stale from partial/failed registration attempts, causing false "existing account" detection.

**Duplicate player prevention**: When accepting an invitation, `handleCompleteRegistration` and `handleExistingUserLogin` first search the local store for an existing player row matching the email/phone. If not found there (due to stale state or load timing), they now call `findPlayerInSupabaseByContact` to query Supabase directly before creating a new row. This prevents the duplicate player bug where the admin-created player row was not found in the local store and a second row was created with a different ID.

**Payment subscriptions**: `player_payments` and `payment_entries` subscriptions guard against cross-team events by checking if the changed row belongs to the current team's payment periods.

**Notification deduplication**: Both game invites and event invites use stable identifiers (`game-invite-${id}`, `event-invite-${id}`) so scheduling the same notification twice replaces rather than duplicates.

## Push Notifications

Push tokens require a valid EAS project ID in `app.json` (`extra.eas.projectId`). The `registerForPushNotificationsAsync` function tries multiple sources: `extra.eas.projectId`, `easConfig.projectId`, and the expoConfig-level `projectId`. If none is found the function returns `null` gracefully (local notifications still work).

**Push token saving**: On login, the token is saved via:
1. A direct `supabase.from('players').update({ push_token }).select('id')` — now uses `.select('id')` to detect 0-row matches (player not yet in Supabase)
2. A full `pushPlayerToSupabase` upsert if the player object is available
3. Retried at +3s and +8s after login to handle slow connections / late team data loads

**Test push notifications**: Admins can send a test push notification to all team members from the Admin tab → Communication → "Test Push Notifications". This shows how many players have registered devices and sends a real notification to verify the pipeline works.

**Self-check-in**: Players always see their own row in the check-in list even before the admin explicitly invites them. Toggling their own status auto-adds them to `invitedPlayers` and writes to `game_responses` / `event_responses` in Supabase. Other team members see the change in real time.
